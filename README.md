# Chat App

Chat App is a real-time chat application built using Node.js and several web technologies.

## Why Did I Build This?

I wanted to apply my current knowledge to create an application that allows users to communicate with each other through real-time messages or voice calls.

## Where Did the Idea Come From?

The inspiration for this project came from wondering how applications like WhatsApp work. I decided to build a similar application to explore these concepts.

## Features

- Real-time chat functionality.
- User authentication.
- Support voice calls.
- User-friendly interface.
- Data storage and retrieval using MongoDB.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The server-side runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for building the server.
- **Session Management (express-session)**: Middleware for managing user sessions, using cookies for secure session authentication.
- **EJS**: A templating engine for rendering dynamic content.
- **CSS and Bootstrap**: Styling and design for the user interface.
- **WebSocket and WebRTC**: Real-time communication and enabling voice calls.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing chat data.
